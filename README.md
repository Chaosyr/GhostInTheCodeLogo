## How To Utilize and Modify:

### Setup:

Configuring will require either Forking or Downloading this repository, rather than installing a release directly (at least for the versions where this text is present.)

1. Install or have any of the following Runtimes/Frameworks or OS's in the form of a DeveloperKit, if you have none the newest (non-prerelease) is reccomended: 
    1. Operating Systems
       1. win-x64
       2. win-x86
       3. win-arm64
       4. linux-x64
       5. linux-arm
       6. linux-arm64
       7. linux-musl-x64
       8. linux-musl-arm64
       9. osx-x64 (MacOS)
       10. browser-wasm
    2. Runtimes/Frameworks
       1. netframework4.7.2
       2. netframework4.8
       3. netframework4.8.1
       4. netstandard2.0
       5. netstandard2.1
       6. net5.0
       7. net6.0
       8. net7.0
       9. net8.0
       10. net9.0
       11. net10.0
2. If you plan (like most) to modify the application to print your own Logo you will need an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) the following are some known and reccomended IDE's:
   1. [JetBrains Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)
   2. [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
   3. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   4. Or alternatively you could edit `Class1.cs` in a text editor than run `Build.bat`, keep in mind the script is built for Windows specifically, and runs through every framework and OS. Output will appear in ZIPS as seen in the Releases section on the GitHub.
       1. OR if you don't want less waiting execute the following commands in Powershell or your Terminal.
         1. `cd "{The Directory this Repository was installed into}"`, if your on windows you can grab the path from the File Explorer Address Bar.
         2. `dotnet build`
         3. Files will be in `bin/{release or debug, terminal should specifiy}/{framework}` than you can just run the executable to test.
3. Edit the `Class1.cs` file to have your Logo, where to do so, and what works is mentioned in the file. If you want to do something more advanced feel free to do so, we made sure to link out to `Cecil.ANSI_Utils` docs for that purpose.
4. Open `GhostInTheCodeLogo.csproj` and update the Description and AssemblyName to match your Logo. Remove the below code from `NuGet.config`, or replace the value with where you want NUGET sending your packages. DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING ELSE UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR DOING.
   1. ```xml
        <config>
            <add key="globalPackagesFolder" value="D:\Nuget" />
        </config>
      ```
5. Build the project with your preferred Build System.
6. Now within the Debug/Release of the bin you will find the updated Terminal Application, you can go into a framework and run it via the Executable created during build time.

### Running:

1. Run the target Executable.
2. If you want a small logo that will look nice use `CTRL+Scrollwheel` and zoom all the way out, than take a screenshot. From there you may need to do some editing but you should get something like the one found here: https://www.youtube.com/@TheGhostInTheCodeBand
